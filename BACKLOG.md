## M13 — Google Play Store

- Create a Play developer account
- Generate a release keystore (replace debug-signed APK)
- Meet Play Store requirements: privacy policy, target API level, 64-bit, etc.
- Submit for review and publish
- Self-update handled by Play once live (no in-app update mechanism needed)

## Ideas / Unscoped

- **Mute alarm with lock button**: pressing the power/lock button while the alarm is sounding should silence the audio (but keep the notification/screen visible until explicitly dismissed or snoozed).
- **Defer to task**: on the alarm screen, instead of (or alongside) time-based snooze, show the current Next Tasks list so the user can pick "I'm doing X now — remind me of this after X is done." Creates an `after_task_done` condition on the fly and re-queues the deferred task. Requires `SchedulerWorker` or a direct trigger on `toggleStatus` to re-surface the task when the blocking one completes.
- **Snooze UX revisit**: replace fixed-duration snooze buttons with a "remind me in X" input (user-specified duration or time). Currently 5/10/15 min hardcoded on the alarm screen.
- **HomeViewModel tick optimization**: replace `while(true)/delay(60s)` with a `tickerFlow` combined via `SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed` so it only ticks while the home screen is visible.
- iOS app
- Cloud sync / backup
- Natural-language task entry ("remind me to call dentist tomorrow at 9am")
